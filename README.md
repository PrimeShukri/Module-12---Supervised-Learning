# Module-12---Supervised-Learning

Background:
    I am a data scientist working on a project to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. I know that credit risk is a classification problem that is inherently imbalanced, meaning that there are far more healthy loans than risky loans.

    For this challenge, I will use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. I will use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company.

    First, I will use the original dataset. I will then resample the data by using the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library. This will create a new dataset that has a more balanced distribution of the target classes.

    I will then use a logistic regression model to train and evaluate both versions of the dataset. I will compare the balanced accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports for the two models.
